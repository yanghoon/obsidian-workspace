### 파일 시스템 구현

* File System
	* Software
	* Data Structure
		* Block = Fixed-Length Chunk
		* Disk = Group of Blocks
		* Partition = Logical Disk Managed Independently
		* Data Region = User Data
		* Metadata
			* superblock
				* number of inode, data block
				* start of region and size
				* file system identifier (magic number)
			* data bitmap, inode bitmap
				* allocation structure : bitmap(used - 1), ~~free list (linked-list)~~
			* inode table = Blocks
			* inode
				* File Metadata = Size, Owner, Permissions, Timestamp
				* 256 bytes (16 inodes in 4K)
				* data file inode
					* block pointer = direct + indirect  + double indirect (multi level index)
				* directory file inode
					* number of tuples (inode number, xxx, length of name)
	* Access Path
		* file read
			* 1) read root inode
			* 2) traverse inodes
			* 3) find i
