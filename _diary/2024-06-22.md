### 파일 시스템 구현

* File System
	* Software
	* Data Structure
		* Block = Fixed-Length Chunk
		* Disk = Group of Blocks
		* Partition = Logical Disk Managed Independently
		* Data Region = User Data
		* Metadata
			* superblock
				* number of inode, data block
				* start of region and size
				* file system identifier (magic number)
			* data bitmap, inode bitmap
				* allocation structure : bitmap(used - 1), ~~free list (linked-list)~~
			* inode table = Blocks
			* inode
				* File Metadata = Size, Owner, Permissions, Timestamp
				* 256 bytes (16 inodes in 4K)
				* data file inode
					* block pointer = direct + indirect  + double indirect (multi level index)
				* directory file inode
					* number of tuples (inode number, xxx, length of name)
	* Access Path
		* file read
			* 1) read root inode (well-known inode number)
			* 2) traverse inodes
			* 3) find target inode
			* 4) read data block
			* 5) write target inode (access time)
		* file write
			* 1) read root inode (well-known inode number)
			* 2) traverse inodes
			* 3) find parent inode
			* 4) write inode bitmap
			* 5) write target inode
			* 6) read target inode
			* 7) write data bitmap
			* 8) write data block
		* caching : for read
		* buffering : for write, lazy, batch
* Crach Consistency
	* Avoid inconsistency between metadata and data
	* Caused by partial-failure or data loss in multiple write operations (allocation, inode, data)
	* fsck
		* Validation and Fix Filesystem metadata
			* superblock, free block
			* inode, directory, duplication
			* bad block
		* Too slow
	* WAL (Write-Ahead Log)
		* Journaling
