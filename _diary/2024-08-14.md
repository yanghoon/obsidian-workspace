#MSA #Monolithic

### Architecture Pattern
#### Monolithic

* Single Process / RDB for Multiple Services
* ==On-Premise (H/W Utilization)==
* Availability (All or Nothing)
* More Coupling, Complexity, Communication Cost
#### Service Oriented Architecture

* ==Multiple Process== / Single RBD for Multiple Services
* Enterprise Service Bus (RPC of Language, Smart Pipe, Monolith)
* Coupling, Complexity
	* Distributed Transaction
	* Performance (Latency, Memory vs Network)
#### Micro Service Architecture

* Process / Database for Each Services
* Virtualization
	* On-Demand, Cloud (Computing / Storage / Network)
	* Container (Lightweight, Portability???)
* ==Agility==, Scalability (Elastic, Scale Out, Distributed)
* Conway's Law, Data Coupling, More Complexity, DevOps
