#MSA #Monolithic

### Architecture Pattern
#### Monolithic

* Single Process / RDB for Multiple Services
* ==On-Premise (H/W Utilization)==
* Availability (All or Nothing)
* More Coupling, Complexity, Communication Cost
#### Service Oriented Architecture

* ==Multiple Process== / Single RBD for Multiple Services
* Enterprise Service Bus (RPC of Language, Smart Pipe, Monolith)
* Coupling, Complexity
	* Distributed Transaction
	* Performance (Latency, Memory vs Network)
#### Micro Service Architecture

* Process / Database for Each Services
* Virtualization
	* On-Demand, Cloud (Computing / Storage / Network)
	* Container (Lightweight, Portability???)
* ==Agility==, Scalability (Elastic, Scale Out, Distributed)
* Conway's Law, Data Coupling, More Complexity, DevOps
### MSA Principles
* Organized around Business Capabilities
* Products not Projects
	* Development + Maintain
* Design for Failure
	* Detect, Self Healing, Eventually Consistency, Decoupling
* ~~Smart endpoints~~ and dumb pipes (~~ESB~~)
  Decentralized Data Management / Governance (~~Single RDB~~)
  Infrastructure Automation (~~On-Premise~~)
  Evolutionary Design
### MSA Components
#### API Gateway
* Facade, Single API Endpoint for Client
* Common Features
	* Auth / Security
	* Routing / Throttling
	* Aggregation
	* Formatting, Logging, ...
* BFF (Client Specific API Gateway, Web / Mobile / IoT)
#### Service Mesh
#### Consistency
* Write - Transaction in Distributed Database
	* Multiple Short / ~~Single Long~~
	* CompensatingÂ Transaction
* Read - Multiple Source of Truth
#### Pipeline
#### Monitoring
* Metric / Log / Tracing
* Direction
	* Pull
	* Push	*
