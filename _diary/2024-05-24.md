### Cache Invalidation & Inconsistency
* Cate Study : Facebook 10 nines Cache Consistency
* Cache Consistency
	* ~~Eviction, TTL~~, Invalidation
	* State Machine
		* Read Path : Static, Immutable
		* Write Path : Database Insert/Update
		* Read + Write Path : Dynamic Cache, Race Condition, Cache Fill + Invalidation
* Cache Tracing
	* Monitoring
		* Timescale (1m, 5m, 10m)
		* Receive Invalidation Event
		  -> Check All Cache Nodes
		  -> Check Freshness from Database
		  -> Count Inconsistency + Republish Invalidation Event
	* Potential Time Window (avoid Write-Heavy)
		* Receive Cache Invalidation Event?
		* Process Cache Invalidation Event?
		* Cache Inconsistency is occurred?

### CLOSED_WAIT and TIME_WAIT
### Sharding (Vitess for MySQL)
* Vitess is MySQL Shard Management Solution
	*Â Open Source, in Kubernetes, from YouTube

		* Kakao(?)
* When apply sharding and how strategies to used?
	* Scale-Up *(...todo: throughput reference...)*
	* Replication (for Read-Heavy, Query Routing with ProxySQL)
	* Vertical Sharding (for Write-Heavy, by Table Groups, to Microservice, more Complex)
	* Horizontal Sharding (for Write-Heavy, by Shard Key, Query Routing/Transaction/Corss Join)
